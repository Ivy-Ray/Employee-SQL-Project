sample_output = """
-- List employees with department and location
SELECT e.name, e.job_role, d.dept_name, d.location
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- Average salary per department
SELECT d.dept_name, AVG(e.package_lpa) AS avg_salary
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;

-- Top 3 performers
SELECT e.name, p.score
FROM Employees e
JOIN Performance p ON e.emp_id = p.emp_id
ORDER BY p.score DESC
LIMIT 3;
